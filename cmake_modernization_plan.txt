Modernization roadmap for CMake (baseline 4.1.2)

1. Normalize dependency acquisition
   - DONE: Replaced codex_fetchcontent_populate() with native FetchContent_Populate calls and standard disconnect flags.
   - Switch to FetchContent_MakeAvailable* helpers while keeping FETCHCONTENT_BASE_DIR/out/cache/third_party semantics (TODO).
   - DONE: Default FETCHCONTENT_UPDATES_DISCONNECTED to ON and expose FETCHCONTENT_FULLY_DISCONNECTED via env toggle, replacing the custom wrapper.

2. Encapsulate third-party setup
   - Relocate bespoke dependency tweaks (libssh2 overrides, libarchive edits, etc.) into focused modules under cmake/deps/ (TODO).
   - Use configure_file() to materialize patch scripts and skip repeated work on reconfigure (TODO).

3. Adopt latest CMake conveniences
   - Introduce cmake_path(), target_sources(FILE_SET ...), generator expressions, and FetchContent_MakeAvailable() where conditional logic or exports can shrink (TODO).
   - Audit remaining policy pushes/pops (CMP0169 etc.) and modernize behaviour instead of forcing OLD modes (TODO).

4. Verification cadence
   - After each modernization milestone, configure from an empty build directory (rm -rf out) and run ./build.sh to validate both dependency builds and the codex-tool target.
   - Track the migration progress (decisions, removed helpers, new presets) in docs/modernizing-cmake.md so automation and future agents can understand the rollout sequence.
