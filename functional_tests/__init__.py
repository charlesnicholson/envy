    WinINet close pooled keep-alive sockets abortively, so a keep-alive stub sees a
    reset while blocked reading the next request line, after the exchange it was
    serving already completed. Every other handler exception is re-raised on the
    serving thread, where __main__'s threading.excepthook records it and fails the run.
