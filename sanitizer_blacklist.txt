# AWS SDK: hashlittle2 overreads string bounds by design (reads 4-byte chunks)
# False positive - overread is into readable memory, doesn't affect correctness
# Triggered by: aws_http_library_init() → s_init_str_to_enum_hash_table()
# Location: aws-c-common/include/aws/common/private/lookup3.inl:552
# Issue: Bob Jenkins' lookup3 hash reads past string end in final 4-byte chunk

# mbedTLS: Crypto code has intentional overreads and benign races
# False positives in optimized crypto routines (e.g., SSL handshake, ECC ops)
# Also has unsynchronized diagnostic counters that don't affect correctness
